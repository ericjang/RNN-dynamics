# Ghosts

Code for my APMA136 Final Project, based on "Opening the Black Box : Low-Dimensional Dynamics in High-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks".

Codes for `simple2d`, `threebit_flipflop`, `motor_control` tasks are found in respective subdirectories. All code written by Eric Jang, under the MIT license. Most of the code is implemented in MATLAB, although there is a bit of python here and there.

A formal, academic writeup for this project can be found at <a href="#TODO">LINK HERE</a> and I have a web-only, informal blog post with supplementary materials <a href="">here</a>.

See the code in examples.
